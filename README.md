This project demonstrates the implementation of a 24-hour digital clock using the PIC18F4580 microcontroller. It combines real-time clock functionality with an interactive user interface, offering two operational modes: Edit Mode for time adjustment and Run Mode for timekeeping. The project highlights the integration of hardware peripherals such as Timer0, Seven-Segment Display (SSD), and a Digital Keypad.
